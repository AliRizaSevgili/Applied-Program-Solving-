1. Start 

2. Declare all the variables:
total_Cost, sub_Total, total_Base, total_Finish,                          
number_Base_Can, number_Finish_Can, 
price_Base, price_Finish, 
tax_Rate, TAXE,

3. Assigning the related variables:
 -the can number of base paint as number_Base_Can;
 -the can number of finishing paint as number_Finish_Can;
 -the tax rate to tax_Rate = 13%;  
 -the base paint price to price_Base = $46.25 per can;  
 -the finishing paint price to price_Finish = $54.50 per can;

4. Calculation and display the output for the sub_Total, total_Base, and total_Finish for the cost of base paint, and the cost of finishing paint before tax. 
    
 a-total_Base = price_Base * number_Base_Can;       
  aa-Display Total Base: total_Base    
 
 b-total_Finish = price_Finish * number_Finish_Can;      
  aa-Display Total Finish: total_Finish     

 c-sub_Total = total_Base + total_Finish; 
  aa-Display Sub-Total: sub_Total

5. Calculation for the tax and display output.
  a-TAXE = sub_Total * tax_Rate;
   aa-Display Tax: TAXE

6. Calculation of the total cost.
  a-total_Cost = sub_Total + TAXE
   aa-Display Total Cost: total_Cost

7. End
